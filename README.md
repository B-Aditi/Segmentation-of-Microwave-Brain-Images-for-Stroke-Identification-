# Segmentation-of-Microwave-Brain-Images-for-Stroke-Identification-
This project presents an AI-powered system for automated segmentation and classification of brain MRI images, aimed at improving stroke and tumor detection. Leveraging deep learning models like CNN and VGG, along with classical machine learning classifiers (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest), the system distinguishes between tumor and non-tumor cases and precisely segments affected brain regions. It features a user-friendly GUI for medical practitioners to upload images, visualize segmentation results, and streamline diagnostic workflows. Future integration with microwave imaging offers potential for real-time, low-cost, and portable stroke diagnosis.
